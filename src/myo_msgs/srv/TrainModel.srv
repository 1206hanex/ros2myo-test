string model_type        # "rf" | "svm" | "knn" | "cnn_lstm" (implement the ones you want now)
string data_dir          # directory containing CSVs from AddGesture (all gestures)
int32 window_size        # for feature models (ignored by cnn_lstm here)
bool  use_imu            # if your CSVs also include IMU features/raw
string out_dir           # where to place artifacts (models/current/ is a nice convention)

# Response
bool success
string message
string model_path        # main artifact path, e.g., gesture_classifier.pkl or gesture_cnn_lstm.h5
